# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services

## Description

This project shows how a Web-Application should be structured. 

The Application includes semantic HTML elements, alt image attributes, and a descriptive title.

Developers can view that heading attributes fall in sequential order as well as the styling follows a logical structure and positioning.

Building this project helped me learn how Web-Applications are structured and how I can make my Web-Applications more accessible.
